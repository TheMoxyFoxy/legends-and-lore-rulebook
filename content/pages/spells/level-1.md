{{% ability name="Polymorph Self" components="S" level="1" ap="2" type="Spell" classes="Sorcerer" range="Self" duration="Concentration, Up to 1 hour" %}}
You transform your body into a beast whose level is equal to your own. During this time, you can only take any actions that beast would reasonably be able to, including any actions not directly mentioned on its stat block. You take on the stats of the beast you transformed into, and once your wounds equals your HP, your concentration is automatically broken. When your concentration is broken or this spell is despelled, you revert to your original form and your wounds revert back to what they were before polymorphing.
