## Accuracy
When rolling with Accuracy, you add an additional `d6` to your roll. If you have multiple instances of Accuracy, you roll that many `d6` and take the highest.

## Advantage
When rolling with Advantage, you roll two dice of the specified type (usually `d20`) and take the highest.

## Automatically Hits
This attack automatically succeeds in hitting, but must still roll to wound unless otherwise stated.

## Automatically Wounds
This attack automatically succeeds in wounding, but must still roll to hit unless otherwise stated.

## Difficulty
When rolling with Difficulty, you subtract a `d6` from your roll. If you have multiple instances of Difficulty, you roll that many `d6` and take the highest. If you have both Difficulty and Accuracy, they cancel out instead of rolling multiple `d6`.

## Disadvantage
When rolling with Disadvantage, you roll two dice of the specified type (usually `d20`) and take the lowest. If you have both Disadvantage and Advantage, they cancel out 1:1.

## Disoriented
While Disoriented, all actions you make for the turn have Difficulty to hit. At the end of each turn, the disoriented character must make a difficulty `12` Durability saving throw to break out of this condition.

## Range of Influence
The largest range of the melee weapons you have equipped.
