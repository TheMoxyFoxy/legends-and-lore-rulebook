{{% ability name="Grapple" ap="2" type="Action" %}}
You use your strength to grapple an enemy in order to initiate a grapple, you do a check against the opponent's STR. Any creature in the grapple may spend 1AP to attempt to beat the other's passive STR, gaining Accuracy or Difficulty depending on how bigger/smaller they are than the other creature.

When you and the enemy are the same size, each creature must beat the other's passive STR to move.

When you are larger than the enemy, you can move without any checks, and the other creature(s) are dragged with you.

If you are smaller than the enemy, you automatically move when the enemy does.
