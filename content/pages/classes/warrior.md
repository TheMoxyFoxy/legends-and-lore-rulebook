# Warrior
Warriors are masters of combat, able to use one or more melee weapons with great effectiveness in battle. Most warriors choose to specialize in one weapon, such as greatswords, a sword and shield, lances, or twin swords. Though they focus on melee combat, there are many types of warriors, all with different goals and focuses.

At level 1, warriors gain a new resource, Stamina, with a maximum amount equal to their warrior level. Many of their skills use Stamina, which regenerates at an amount equal to your Strength. Whenever you end your turn without using Stamina, you regenerate again.

You also gain these abilities:

{{% ability name="Weakpoint" ap="0" cost="1 Stamina" type="Action" %}}Your next nonmagical attack gains +1 to wound. Can only be used once per combat. {{% /ability %}}
{{% ability name="Flank" type="Passive" %}}Your nonmagical attacks gain Accuracy to hit when attacking an enemy if the last ally they attacked this combat is not within your range of influence.{{% /ability %}}
