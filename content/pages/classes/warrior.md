# Warrior
Warriors are masters of combat, able to use one or more melee weapons with great effectiveness in battle. Most warriors choose to specialize in one weapon, such as greatswords, a sword and shield, lances, or twin swords. Though they focus on melee combat, there are many types of warriors, all with different goals and focuses.

## Building a Warrior
A warrior's hit die is a `d8` and they are proficient in both martial and basic weapons as well as heavy armor and below.

At level 1, warriors gain a new resource, Stamina, with a maximum amount equal to their Strength. Many of their skills use Stamina, which regenerates by 1 at the end of your turn. Whenever you end your turn without using Stamina, you instead regenerate 3. You start each battle with maximum stamina.

You also gain these abilities at level 1:

Increase your AC by 1 until the start of your next turn.
