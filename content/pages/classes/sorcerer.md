# Sorcerer
At some point during your life, whether it be from birth or later, you discovered a link to the Flow, the natural ebb and flow of mana around you. You are able to control this mana, as well as the mana within you via your Mana Gate, casting powerful spells to aid allies and decimate foes.

You gain Mana Slots as you level up according to the below table. A sorcerer’s Mana Gate can only take so much spellcasting, so sorcerers have built their spells to account to this, upholding to certain thresholds called “Mana Slots levels”. These only regenerate during a short rest, where you can only regain half of your slots, or a long rest, where you regain all of them. In times of desperate need, you can overexert your Mana Gate to regain Mana Slots.
