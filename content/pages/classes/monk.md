# Monk

## Building a Monk
A monk's hit die is a `d8` and they are proficient in both martial and basic weapons as well as light armor.

At level 1, monks gain access to Ki. You start each battle with 0 Ki and gain 1 each time you hit an enemy with a melee attack.

You also gain these abilities at level 1:
{{% ability name="Strike Like Wind" ki="1" type="Action" %}}
Your next attack costs 1 less AP.
{{% /ability %}}

{{% ability name="Exalted Strike" ki="2" type="Action" %}}
Your next attack is guaranteed to wound if it hits.
