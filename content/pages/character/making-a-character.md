# Making a Character
There are a couple steps you must follow when making a character. It can be a lot at first, but don't worry! As all things, it will get easier with time.
1. Select your character's race, name, etc.
2. Select your character's class.
3. Assign your base stats, including the bonuses from your race. You start with 3 points to assign to your stats and cannot put any more than 2 in a single one.
4. Assign your HP. At level 1 you gain the full hit die from your class + your Durability. At higher levels when adding to your HP, you can either roll and add Durability or take the average and add Durability.
5. If your class has a resource, be sure to note the amount/kind you have.
6. Select up to two weapon. You can only equip weapons you are proficient in, and you can equip either 2 one-handed weapons or 1 two-handed weapon.
7. Select an armor for your character. You can now set your AC to 8 + AC Bonuses obtained by any equipped items.
8. Note down all skills you have access to from your class and weapon(s) (if applicable).
9. If you are a magic-based class, learn spells as designated by your class.
