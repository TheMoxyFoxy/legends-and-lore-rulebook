# Resting
As you adventure, your resources may deplete. Your character will get wounded, exhausted, and will need to rest. There are two types of rest.

## Short Rest
You rest for 3-6 hours, restoring half of your hit dice (1 for each class level). You remove wounds equal to the result of rolling those dice. Some classes may restore resources as well, such as spell slots. Each class will describe how it restores its resource.

## Long Rest
You rest for 7-12 hours, restoring all of your wounds and regaining all of your resources.
