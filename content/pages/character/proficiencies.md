# Proficiencies
Proficiencies are various tasks that your character is especially proficient in. These are roleplay-oriented and cannot be used in combat, unless otherwise specified by the DM for certain scenarios. These proficiencies are modified by a stat decided by your DM. You also gain Accuracy when performing a proficiency roll. Proficiencies can be anything you can possibly think of, but cannot be overly vague. Here are a few examples of possible proficiencies:
| Proficiency          | Possible Stat(s) | Description |
| -------------------: | :--------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Stop in Their Tracks | DUR              | Use your large and durable body to completely block someone from getting past you and escaping without need for spells. |
| Intimidation         | STR/WIS          | Intimidate the target either through brute strength or cunning manipulation.                                            |
| Crafting             | DEX/INT          | You are able to efficiently craft various minor equipment for you to use during exploration.                            |
| Sleight of Hand      | DEX              | Use your dextrous hands to swiftly snatch an item from someone or someplace without being noticed.                      |
| Investigation        | INT              | Use your intelligence to decipher clues for a specific topic.                                                           |
| Gather Information   | WIS              | You are quite the smooth talker, and are able to easily gather information from someone without raising suspicion.      |
| Nature               | WIS              | Your knowledge of nature is profound, and you are able to easily recognize various plants and natural phenomena.        |

These proficiencies must be discussed with the DM before your first session using them.

{{% hint info %}}
Proficiencies are always rolled with a `d20` and an additional `d6` for Accuracy. Then, you add your stat modifier.

The total roll becomes `d20 + d6 + MOD`.
