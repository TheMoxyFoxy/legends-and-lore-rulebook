# Human
Humans are one of the most versatile beings in the world, able to adapt to any environment easily and able to spread faster than any other species. While other species have to wait years or even decades for their young, humans take less than a year, though their lives are quite short compared to most species. Humans that survive to old age usually only live several decades; only in extremely rare cases do they live to or even beyond a century. However, due to their versatility, humans do not exhibit any particular strengths, being more of a “jack of all trades” compared to others.
