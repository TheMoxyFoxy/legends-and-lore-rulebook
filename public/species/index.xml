 Elfen
 
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#elfen"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
 
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elfen are beings of nature and community. They are plant-like beings born from seeds that take years to sprout. These young are called Saphalin, and only after a decade do they begin to show signs of what type of Elfen they will become. An Elfen is only considered an adult once it blossoms. This is different for every Elfen, but is almost always accompanied by petal-like structures growing on their body and their colors becoming much brighter and more saturated. When an Elfen is about to blossom, they enter an almost hibernating, dormant state. This can last for a couple days to up to a week. After this, the Elfen will decide what it wishes to do, whether that is staying in the village and fulfilling a job or exploring the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
