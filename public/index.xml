 Human
 
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#human"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
 
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans are one of the most versatile beings in the world, able to adapt to any environment easily and able to spread faster than any other species. While other species have to wait years or even decades for their young, humans take less than a year, though their lives are quite short compared to most species. Humans that survive to old age usually only live several decades; only in extremely rare cases do they live to or even beyond a century. However, due to their versatility, humans do not exhibit any particular strengths, being more of a “jack of all trades” compared to others.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Dwarv</title><link>http://localhost:1313/pages/species/dwarf/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 12:08:55 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/pages/species/dwarf/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="dwarv"&gt;
 Dwarv
 
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#dwarv"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
 
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dwarves are a species of sentient golems created by the first Rune Carvers of the ancient Eos. The intention of their creation is unknown, lost to time after their destruction. Dwarves start as a Husk, several mana crystals combined and imbued into a material body with a ritual designed by their creators. This ritual somehow enchants the crystals with unknown runic power, creating an artificial but true soul. Even Dwarves do not understand the ritual, the magic somehow feeling innate to them, but so complex even the smartest of them haven’t come anywhere close to figuring out where to even start parsing it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Elfen</title><link>http://localhost:1313/pages/species/elfen/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 12:08:55 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/pages/species/elfen/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="elfen"&gt;
 Elfen
 
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#elfen"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
 
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elfen are beings of nature and community. They are plant-like beings born from seeds that take years to sprout. These young are called Saphalin, and only after a decade do they begin to show signs of what type of Elfen they will become. An Elfen is only considered an adult once it blossoms. This is different for every Elfen, but is almost always accompanied by petal-like structures growing on their body and their colors becoming much brighter and more saturated. When an Elfen is about to blossom, they enter an almost hibernating, dormant state. This can last for a couple days to up to a week. After this, the Elfen will decide what it wishes to do, whether that is staying in the village and fulfilling a job or exploring the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
