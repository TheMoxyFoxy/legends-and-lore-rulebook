  Elfen
  
  #
  

Elfen are beings of nature and community. They are plant-like beings born from seeds that take years to sprout. These young are called Saphalin, and only after a decade do they begin to show signs of what type of Elfen they will become. An Elfen is only considered an adult once it blossoms. This is different for every Elfen, but is almost always accompanied by petal-like structures growing on their body and their colors becoming much brighter and more saturated. When an Elfen is about to blossom, they enter an almost hibernating, dormant state. This can last for a couple days to up to a week. After this, the Elfen will decide what it wishes to do, whether that is staying in the village and fulfilling a job or exploring the outside world."><meta name=theme-color media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" content="#ffffff"><meta name=theme-color media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" content="#343a40"><meta name=color-scheme content="light dark"><meta property="og:url" content="http://localhost:1313/pages/species/elfen/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Legends & Lore Core Rulebook"><meta property="og:title" content="Elfen"><meta property="og:description" content="Elfen#Elfen are beings of nature and community.

<a class=anchor href=#elfen>#</a></h1><p>Elfen are beings of nature and community. They are plant-like beings born from seeds that take years to sprout. These young are called Saphalin, and only after a decade do they begin to show signs of what type of Elfen they will become. An Elfen is only considered an adult once it blossoms. This is different for every Elfen, but is almost always accompanied by petal-like structures growing on their body and their colors becoming much brighter and more saturated. When an Elfen is about to blossom, they enter an almost hibernating, dormant state. This can last for a couple days to up to a week. After this, the Elfen will decide what it wishes to do, whether that is staying in the village and fulfilling a job or exploring the outside world.</p><p>Some Elfen may choose the latter instead of staying in their village. However, an Elfen cannot stay away from nature for too long. If they are away from nature or sunlight for extended periods of time, they begin to feel weakened and exhausted. However, it doesn’t take much to renew them. A nice rest in a forest or garden or a dip in a spring perks them right up. Also, though they don’t usually wear clothing in their villages, they often do in the outside world, whether it be for protection, to fit in with other species, or just because they like fashion!</p><p>Unlike the other species, Elfen don’t have mouths or eyes and instead communicate telepathically and see the world around them through the Flow. Though, they don’t have the greatest control over their telepathy, only able to change the distance when focusing, and unable to focus it towards a specific person, similar to speech. However, this allows them to communicate in more ways than just speech, such as images and even full memories. Instead of eyes and a mouth, Elfen typically have patterns in their petals which resemble them, and it differs from one to the next. One Elfen may have eyelash-like lines, another may have what looks like flat, mono-coloured eyes, and another may even have markings resembling a moustache. Due to the large variety and diversity of Elfen anatomy, they often have difficulty discerning individuals in other species from one another. Though, with several years of consistent interaction with other species, such as Elfen explorers and adventurers, they often learn quite well. Elfen also do not require food, instead relying on water, the sun, and the naturally higher mana density in nature to survive.</p><h2 id=priscia>Priscia
<a class=anchor href=#priscia>#</a></h2><p>A Priscia is a small Elfen ranging from 4’ to 5’, usually sporting more elegant and flowing petals than others. Despite their height, they contain powerful magic. These Elfen tend to choose to become scholars for their tribe, writing the tribe’s history as well as delving into the machinations of nature. As adventurers, they are often sorcerers or runecarvers.</p><blockquote class="book-hint info"><p><strong>Bonuses</strong></p><p>Elfen Priscia get a <strong>+1</strong> to Intellect (INT) and Wisdom (WIS).</p></blockquote><h2 id=gigantia>Gigantia
<a class=anchor href=#gigantia>#</a></h2><p>A Gigantia is an Elfen that can be almost double the height of the shortest Elfens, ranging from 6’ to almost 8’. These Elfen typically have much bulkier builds, their skin as tough as a tree. They use this to their advantage, their bodies being completely immune to dangerous thorns in the woods and being able to more easily deflect blades. They often choose to become the tribe’s defenders, protecting the Garden where the seeds sprout from unwanted pests and threats.</p><blockquote class="book-hint info"><p><strong>Bonuses</strong></p><p>Elfen Gigantia get a <strong>+1</strong> to Constitution (CON) and <strong>+2</strong> to Armor Class (AC).</p></blockquote><h2 id=sprintia>Sprintia
<a class=anchor href=#sprintia>#</a></h2><p>A Sprintia is a usually taller and much leaner Elfen, able to swiftly move in their environment. They can be as short as 5’ or as tall as 7’. These Elfen typically have long and thin petals, complimenting their leaner build. They often choose to become scouts for the tribe, delving deep into their environment to search for possible threats.</p><blockquote class="book-hint info"><p><strong>Bonuses</strong></p><p>Elfen Sprintia get a <strong>+2</strong> to Dexterity (DEX).</p></blockquote></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"><span><a href=/pages/species/dwarf/ class="flex align-center book-icon"><img src=/svg/backward.svg class=book-icon alt=Previous title=Dwarv>
