Dwarves are a species of sentient golems created by the first Rune Carvers of the ancient Eos. The intention of their creation is unknown, lost to time after their destruction. Dwarves start as a Husk, several mana crystals combined and imbued into a material body with a ritual designed by their creators. This ritual somehow enchants the crystals with unknown runic power, creating an artificial but true soul. Even Dwarves do not understand the ritual, the magic somehow feeling innate to them, but so complex even the smartest of them haven’t come anywhere close to figuring out where to even start parsing it."><meta name=theme-color media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" content="#ffffff"><meta name=theme-color media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" content="#343a40"><meta name=color-scheme content="light dark"><meta property="og:url" content="http://localhost:1313/pages/species/dwarf/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Legends & Lore Core Rulebook"><meta property="og:title" content="Dwarv"><meta property="og:description" content="Dwarv#Dwarves are a species of sentient golems created by the first Rune Carvers of the ancient Eos.

<a class=anchor href=#dwarv>#</a></h1><p>Dwarves are a species of sentient golems created by the first Rune Carvers of the ancient Eos. The intention of their creation is unknown, lost to time after their destruction. Dwarves start as a Husk, several mana crystals combined and imbued into a material body with a ritual designed by their creators. This ritual somehow enchants the crystals with unknown runic power, creating an artificial but true soul. Even Dwarves do not understand the ritual, the magic somehow feeling innate to them, but so complex even the smartest of them haven’t come anywhere close to figuring out where to even start parsing it.</p><p>A Dwarvish Husk is a young Dwarv, a simple, somewhat humanoid, material body thrown together by one or more Dwarves performing the ritual. Part of their becoming of age is to form their preferred body themselves. Once they do, this form will become imprinted to their soul. Whenever their body becomes damaged and repairs itself, it will always repair to this imprinted form. Some Dwarves, particularly those that are unskilled in crafts, may choose to have their parents, or someone they find near and dear, to craft their body instead. As a Dwarv grows older and changes as a person, they may also find their imprinted body change to match the differences.</p><p>Dwarves require eating mana crystals to sustain themselves. Though they are able to eat other foods and absorb the latent mana inside of them, mana crystals taste utterly delicious to them and fill them more than any food could. Due to their reliance on crafts for their body and mana crystals for sustenance, Dwarves are oftentimes crafters and miners. This does wonders for trading and their economy thrives off of their skilled craftsman and plentiful resources in places other races find extremely dangerous to explore.</p><h2 id=building-a-dwarv>Building a Dwarv
